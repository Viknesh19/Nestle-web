                WHOLE GRAIN</h1>
                <p>All of our breakfast cereal recipes have whole grain as the #1 ingredient and 96% of them carrying the green banner has a minimum 8g of whole grain per serving!

                We were the first major global cereal company to commit to having whole grain as the No. 1 ingredient. Since 2003 we are very proud to have introduced 50% more whole grain to our products.</p>

                VITAMINS & MINERALS</h1>
                <p>We enrich our cereals by adding vitamins and minerals to most of them, although the amount varies according to geographical areas and current legislation. Whenever vitamins or minerals are added to one of our products, we ensure that these additions correspond to at least 15% of the recommended daily allowance per serving.</p>

                     SALT</h1>
                <p>We add a pinch of salt to our cereals to improve their taste and texture. Each of our nutritious breakfast cereals has a very specific recipe that has been developed through numerous consumer tests. Thus, we can offer you a product that you will love, both with a delicious taste and a long shelf life.
                    
                We have been working to reduce salt levels gradually in our cereals over the last fifteen years, already cutting salt by 25% on average.</p>

                    SUGAR</h1>
                <p>Sugar preserves, gives a texture, a nice golden colour and, of course, a sweeter flavour. Most cereal is made mostly from grain, which can make it a good source of fibre and contains vitamins and minerals. So, sugar is merely its partner (or maybe we should say sweetheart?). Since 2003 we have reduced sugar in our products by 20%.
